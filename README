== BUILDING

Building is only supported on Linux. This is because of GTK port of Webkit: I didn't manage to build 
The requirements are pretty standard: Haskell Platform [1], Haskell bindings for gtk [2] and gtkwebkit [3].

Haskell Platform should be packaged for your distribution/OS already and so should be gtk's bindings. This is unlikely for webkit bindings.

> git clone git://github.com/Tener/spike.git
> cd spike
> cabal update # just to be sure
> cabal install --user # this should install needed dependencies and finally spike 

== INSTALLATION

After building with cabal-install the executable will be installed to ~/.cabal/bin/spike (assuming default cabal-install config). You can either add this folder to your PATH or copy the 'spike' executable anywhere you like. This will be the only file you will need to run the browser. The binary 'spike' will also be present in spike/dist/build/spike/spike path.

== USAGE

Please see the video on Youtube (TODO).

User data is stored in ~/.Spike/ folder.
